# GetRPKM
This application imports a data file created by rSubRead that contains all the reads mapping to the transcripts in a GTF file and creates a reads per transcript kilobase per million reads in the library (aligned reads). To do this the read count file needs the gene SYMBOL appending to the file which can be done with the R script in the R_script folder. (The values of the variables on lined 6 and 7 will need to be altered to select your data etc.)
